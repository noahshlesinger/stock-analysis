# Stock-Analysis
Analyzing stocks using VBA
## Overview: Explain the purpose of the analysis

### Results
Using images and examples of your code, compare stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refractored script
### Summary: In a summary statement, address the following
1. What are the advantages or disadantages of refractoring code?
  You can run larger amounts of data and not use as much computer memory and won't wait as long. Doesn't search through ALL the data every single time a for loop runs. it idealizes it for a single purpose but copying and pasting for a different data set might be confusing.
  
3. How do these pros and cons apply to refractoring the original VBA script?
 Cons: the stocks listed in the array need to be in the order that they appear in the data set and the data set has to be filtered ahead of time so that all rows of data of a single stock ticker is together with no other stocks in the middle.
